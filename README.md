# Tock: The Tick-Aware Orchestrator of Chunk Kinetics

A server-side-only Fabric mod that brings adaptive, low-overhead tick scheduling, dynamic chunk prioritization, and CPU-budget-aware execution to the Minecraft server tick loop.

## Features

### üß† NeuroTick ‚Äì Tick Budget Governor
- Prevents lag spikes by distributing heavy workloads across multiple ticks
- Maintains a cost profile per tick task type
- Implements a low-cost PID-style controller for adapting to server load

### üî≥ ChunkFuse ‚Äì Adaptive Chunk Activity Graph
- Only ticks what players actually see, use, or influence
- Builds a lightweight visibility + usage graph of loaded chunks
- Marks chunks as "cold" when inactive

### üêå SnailSpawn ‚Äì Controlled Entity Spawning
- Fine-tuned, lag-free mob spawning
- Per-entity-type spawn queues with load-aware delay injection
- Area-specific spawn pacing

### üß± BlockCache ‚Äì High-Speed Read-Only Block Data
- Safe API for plugins to inspect chunks without loading them
- Creates an async, tick-updated cache of blockstates
- No chunk loads, no memory explosions
